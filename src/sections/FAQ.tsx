    question: 'Is OpenLovable free? What\'s the catch?',
    answer: 'OpenLovable is completely free and open-source. There\'s no catch—you can use it forever without paying anything. The only costs are if you choose to use paid AI API keys, but you can also use free models from Google, OpenRouter, or run local models with Ollama at zero cost.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What can you build with OpenLovable?',
    answer: 'You can build full-stack web applications with React, Next.js, or vanilla JavaScript. OpenLovable supports database integration with Supabase, authentication, API endpoints, and deployment to GitHub and Vercel. From simple landing pages to complex SaaS applications, OpenLovable can handle it all.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you build desktop apps with OpenLovable?',
    answer: 'Yes! OpenLovable supports building desktop applications using Capacitor. You can create cross-platform desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux from your web codebase. Mobile app support is also available for iOS and Android.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is OpenLovable different from Bolt or Lovable?',
    answer: 'OpenLovable runs locally on your machine, giving you complete privacy and control over your code. Unlike cloud-based tools, your code never leaves your computer unless you choose to deploy it. OpenLovable is also fully open-source, so you can inspect, modify, and extend the codebase.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need coding experience to use OpenLovable?',
    answer: 'No coding experience is required! OpenLovable uses natural language prompts to generate working applications. Just describe what you want to build, and OpenLovable will create the code for you. However, having some basic understanding of web development can help you write better prompts.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use OpenLovable offline?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! If you set up local AI models using Ollama, you can use OpenLovable completely offline. This is perfect for working on airplanes, in areas with poor internet, or when you want maximum privacy for your projects.',
